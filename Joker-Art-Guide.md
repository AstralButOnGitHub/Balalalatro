# hello every!

This is a quick explanation on how *I (A Balatro Modder)* makes his Joker art!

## Ideas!

Getting ideas is different for everyone.
If you can't think of anything ask someone! there's NEVER any shame in asking for help. (this is not a joke(r))
That being said, I like to just look at my surroundings and things that interest me! (also throw sh\*t at the wall.)

**Example:** I've been **modding** Minecraft *waaay* longer than I have for Balatro so I was wanting to make an Error joker based on Minecraft's (and source's) Error Texture!

I also like Starting with an Idea to make the Art or Making the Art and trying to come up with an idea!


## Art!

Making pixel art is a whole other thing to study but If you can make pixel art you can make a Joker!

Things to keep in mind when making a Joker:

The main focus should be a Joker, an Object, or a Place. Examples: (Madness, Bloodstone, Castle)

You should try to stick with the pixel art asthetic as much as possible (even *if* you're trying to make a non-pixel joker.)

I feel I should explain that last one, Let's say you have a "realistic joker" where it's a real photo. The photo should be downscaled to the resolution of the Jokers (71, 95) so it doesn't stick out like a sore thumb.

Also; [Anti(Ante)-Aliasing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-aliasing) Can be good in moderation but using art programs that don't allow for low to no Anti-Aliasing Can make the image look muddy.

Also Also; Often times with pixel art using [Hue Shifting](https://www.reddit.com/r/PixelArt/comments/hhqx71/guide_to_hue_shifting/) is Ideal but The Joker Cards don't really use it! So keep that in mind.

1 last thing: Have Fun!
